title: "State: コンポーネントの記憶"
---

<Intro>

コンポーネントは、インタラクションの結果として画面上の表示を変更する必要がよくあります。フォームに入力すると入力欄が更新されるべきであり、画像カルーセルで「次へ」をクリックすると表示される画像が変わるべきであり、「購入」をクリックすると商品がショッピングカートに入るべきです。コンポーネントは、現在の入力値、現在の画像、ショッピングカートなどの「記憶」が必要です。React では、このようなコンポーネント固有のメモリは *state* と呼ばれます。

`handleClick` イベントハンドラは、ローカル変数 `index` を更新しています。しかし、2 つのことがその変更が目に見えるのを妨げています。

1. **ローカル変数はレンダリング間で持続しません。** React がこのコンポーネントを 2 回目にレンダーするとき、最初からレンダーし直します。つまり、ローカル変数の変更は考慮されません。
2. **Changes to local variables won't trigger renders.** React doesn't realize it needs to render the component again with the new data.
2. **ローカル変数への変更はレンダーをトリガーしません。** React は新しいデータで再度コンポーネントをレンダーする必要があることに気付きません。

To update a component with new data, two things need to happen:
コンポーネントを新しいデータで更新するためには、以下の 2 つのことが必要です。

1. **Retain** the data between renders.
1. レンダー間でデータを**保持する**。
2. **Trigger** React to render the component with new data (re-rendering).
2. 新しいデータでコンポーネントをレンダーする（再レンダー）ために React を**トリガする**。

[`useState`](/reference/react/useState) フックは、これら 2 つの機能を提供します。

1. レンダー間でデータを保持するための **state 変数**。
2. 変数を更新し、React が再度コンポーネントをレンダーするようにトリガする **state セッタ関数**。

## state 変数を追加する {/*adding-a-state-variable*/}

state 変数を追加するには、ファイルの先頭で React から `useState` をインポートします。

```js
import { useState } from 'react';
```

そして次の行を、

```js
let index = 0;
```

以下に置き換えます。

```js
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```

`index` は state 変数であり、`setIndex` はセッタ関数です。


これが handleClick 内でどのように連携して動作するかは次の通りです：

> ここでの `[` と `]` の構文は [配列の分割代入](https://javascript.info/destructuring-assignment) と呼ばれ、配列から値を読み取ることができます。`useState` によって返される配列には常に正確に 2 つの要素が含まれています。

これが `handleClick` 内でどのように連携して動作するかは次の通りです。

```js
function handleClick() {
  setIndex(index + 1);
}
```

これで、「Next」ボタンをクリックすると現在の彫刻が切り替わります。

### はじめてのフックに出会う {/*meet-your-first-hook*/}

React では、`useState` をはじめ、"`use`" で始まる他の関数もフックと呼ばれます。

*フック* は、React がレンダー中にのみ利用可能な特殊な関数です（次のページで詳しく説明します）。フックを使うことで、さまざまな React の機能を「引っ掛ける」ことができます。

State はその機能の 1 つに過ぎませんが、後で他のフックにも出会うことになります。

<Pitfall>

**フック、つまり `use` で始まる関数は、コンポーネントのトップレベルか[独自のフック](/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks)でのみ呼び出すことができます。** 条件、ループ、または他のネストされた関数の中でフックを呼び出すことはできません。フックは関数ですが、コンポーネントのニーズに関する無条件の宣言として考えるとわかりやすくなります。コンポーネントのトップで React の機能を「使用」するのは、ファイルのトップでモジュールを「インポート」するのに似ています。

</Pitfall>

### `useState` の構造 {/*anatomy-of-usestate*/}

[`useState`](/reference/react/useState) を呼び出すとき、React にこのコンポーネントが何かを覚えておくことを要求しています：

```js
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```

これは React に `index` を覚えておいてほしい場合です。

<Note>

慣習的にはこのペアには、`const [何か, set何か]` のように名前を付けます。好きな名前を付けることができますが、慣習に従うことがプロジェクト間の理解を簡単にします。

</Note>

`useState` の唯一の引数は、state 変数の**初期値**です。この例では、`useState(0)` で `index` の初期値が `0` に設定されています。

コンポーネントがレンダーされるたびに、`useState` は次の 2 つの値が入った配列を返します。

1. 保存した値を持つ state 変数 (`index`)。
2. state 変数を更新し、React がコンポーネントを再レンダリングするのをトリガーする **state セッタ関数** (`setIndex`)。

これが実際にどのように動作するかを見てみましょう。

```js
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```

1. **コンポーネントが初めてレンダーされる。** `useState` に `index` の初期値として `0` を渡すので、`[0, setIndex]` が返されます。 React は最新の state の値が `0` であることを記憶しています。
2. **state を更新します。**ユーザーがボタンをクリックすると、 `setIndex(index + 1)` が呼び出されます。 `index` は `0` なので、 `setIndex(1)` です。これにより、React は `index` が今 `1` であると覚えておくよう指示し、もう一度レンダーがトリガーされます。
3. **コンポーネントの2回目のレンダー。**React はまだ useState(0) を見ますが、React が `index` を `1` に設定したことを覚えているため、代わりに `[1, setIndex]` を返します。
4. これが続きます！

## コンポーネントに複数の state 変数を与える {/*giving-a-component-multiple-state-variables*/}

1 つのコンポーネントに、好きなだけ多くの種類の state 変数を持たせることができます。このコンポーネントには 2 つの state 変数があり、数値の `index` と、「Show details」をクリックすると切り替わる真偽値の `showMore` があります。

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  function handleNextClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleNextClick}>

It is a good idea to have multiple state variables if their state is unrelated, like `index` and `showMore` in this example. But if you find that you often change two state variables together, it might be easier to combine them into one. For example, if you have a form with many fields, it's more convenient to have a single state variable that holds an object than state variable per field. Read [Choosing the State Structure](/learn/choosing-the-state-structure) for more tips.

<DeepDive>

#### How does React know which state to return? {/*how-does-react-know-which-state-to-return*/}

You might have noticed that the `useState` call does not receive any information about *which* state variable it refers to. There is no "identifier" that is passed to `useState`, so how does it know which of the state variables to return? Does it rely on some magic like parsing your functions? The answer is no.

Instead, to enable their concise syntax, Hooks **rely on a stable call order on every render of the same component.** This works well in practice because if you follow the rule above ("only call Hooks at the top level"), Hooks will always be called in the same order. Additionally, a [linter plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) catches most mistakes.

Internally, React holds an array of state pairs for every component. It also maintains the current pair index, which is set to `0` before rendering. Each time you call `useState`, React gives you the next state pair and increments the index. You can read more about this mechanism in [React Hooks: Not Magic, Just Arrays.](https://medium.com/@ryardley/react-hooks-not-magic-just-arrays-cd4f1857236e)

This example **doesn't use React** but it gives you an idea of how `useState` works internally:

<Sandpack>

```js index.js active
let componentHooks = [];
let currentHookIndex = 0;

// How useState works inside React (simplified).
function useState(initialState) {
  let pair = componentHooks[currentHookIndex];
  if (pair) {
    // This is not the first render,

You don't have to understand it to use React, but you might find this a helpful mental model.

## State is isolated and private {/*state-is-isolated-and-private*/}

State is local to a component instance on the screen. In other words, **if you render the same component twice, each copy will have completely isolated state!** Changing one of them will not affect the other.

In this example, the `Gallery` component from earlier is rendered twice with no changes to its logic. Try clicking the buttons inside each of the galleries. Notice that their state is independent:

<Sandpack>

```js
import Gallery from './Gallery.js';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div className="Page">
      <Gallery />
      <Gallery />
    </div>
  );
}

```

```js Gallery.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  function handleNextClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <section>
      <button onClick={handleNextClick}>
        Next
      </button>

This is what makes state different from regular variables that you might declare at the top of your module. State is not tied to a particular function call or a place in the code, but it's "local" to the specific place on the screen. You rendered two `<Gallery />` components, so their state is stored separately.

Also notice how the `Page` component doesn't "know" anything about the `Gallery` state or even whether it has any. Unlike props, **state is fully private to the component declaring it.** The parent component can't change it. This lets you add state to any component or remove it without impacting the rest of the components.

What if you wanted both galleries to keep their states in sync? The right way to do it in React is to *remove* state from child components and add it to their closest shared parent. The next few pages will focus on organizing state of a single component, but we will return to this topic in [Sharing State Between Components.](/learn/sharing-state-between-components)

<Recap>

* Use a state variable when a component needs to "remember" some information between renders.
* State variables are declared by calling the `useState` Hook.
* Hooks are special functions that start with `use`. They let you "hook into" React features like state.
* Hooks might remind you of imports: they need to be called unconditionally. Calling Hooks, including `useState`, is only valid at the top level of a component or another Hook.
* The `useState` Hook returns a pair of values: the current state and the function to update it.
* You can have more than one state variable. Internally, React matches them up by their order.
* State is private to the component. If you render it in two places, each copy gets its own state.

</Recap>



<Challenges>

#### Complete the gallery {/*complete-the-gallery*/}

When you press "Next" on the last sculpture, the code crashes. Fix the logic to prevent the crash. You may do this by adding extra logic to event handler or by disabling the button when the action is not possible.

After fixing the crash, add a "Previous" button that shows the previous sculpture. It shouldn't crash on the first sculpture.

  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  let hasPrev = index > 0;
  let hasNext = index < sculptureList.length - 1;

  function handlePrevClick() {

      setIndex(index - 1);
    }
  }

  function handleNextClick() {
    if (hasNext) {
      setIndex(index + 1);
    }
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];

Notice how `hasPrev` and `hasNext` are used *both* for the returned JSX and inside the event handlers! This handy pattern works because event handler functions ["close over"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) any variables declared while rendering.

#### Fix stuck form inputs {/*fix-stuck-form-inputs*/}

When you type into the input fields, nothing appears. It's like the input values are "stuck" with empty strings. The `value` of the first `<input>` is set to always match the `firstName` variable, and the `value` for the second `<input>` is set to always match the `lastName` variable. This is correct. Both inputs have `onChange` event handlers, which try to update the variables based on the latest user input (`e.target.value`). However, the variables don't seem to "remember" their values between re-renders. Fix this by using state variables instead.

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function Form() {
  let firstName = '';
  let lastName = '';

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    firstName = e.target.value;
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    lastName = e.target.value;
  }

  function handleReset() {
    firstName = '';
    lastName = '';
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={e => e.preventDefault()}>
      <input
        placeholder="First name"
        value={firstName}
        onChange={handleFirstNameChange}
      />
      <input
        placeholder="Last name"
        value={lastName}
        onChange={handleLastNameChange}
      />
      <h1>Hi, {firstName} {lastName}</h1>
      <button onClick={handleReset}>Reset</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

```css 
h1 { margin-top: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

First, import `useState` from React. Then replace `firstName` and `lastName` with state variables declared by calling `useState`. Finally, replace every `firstName = ...` assignment with `setFirstName(...)`, and do the same for `lastName`. Don't forget to update `handleReset` too so that the reset button works.

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    setFirstName(e.target.value);
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    setLastName(e.target.value);
  }

  function handleReset() {
    setFirstName('');
    setLastName('');
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={e => e.preventDefault()}>
      <input
        placeholder="First name"
        value={firstName}
        onChange={handleFirstNameChange}
      />
      <input
        placeholder="Last name"
        value={lastName}
        onChange={handleLastNameChange}
      />
      <h1>Hi, {firstName} {lastName}</h1>
      <button onClick={handleReset}>Reset</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

```css 
h1 { margin-top: 10px; }
```

#### Fix a crash {/*fix-a-crash*/}

Here is a small form that is supposed to let the user leave some feedback. When the feedback is submitted, it's supposed to display a thank-you message. However, it crashes with an error message saying "Rendered fewer hooks than expected". Can you spot the mistake and fix it?

<Hint>

Are there any limitations on _where_ Hooks may be called? Does this component break any rules? Check if there are any comments disabling the linter checks--this is where the bugs often hide!

</Hint>

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);
  if (isSent) {
    return <h1>Thank you!</h1>;
  } else {
    // eslint-disable-next-line
    const [message, setMessage] = useState('');
    return (
      <form onSubmit={e => {
        e.preventDefault();
        alert(`Sending: "${message}"`);
        setIsSent(true);
      }}>
        <textarea
          placeholder="Message"
          value={message}
          onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}
        />
        <br />
        <button type="submit">Send</button>
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

Hooks can only be called at the top level of the component function. Here, the first `isSent` definition follows this rule, but the `message` definition is nested in a condition.

Move it out of the condition to fix the issue:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  if (isSent) {
    return <h1>Thank you!</h1>;
  } else {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={e => {
        e.preventDefault();
        alert(`Sending: "${message}"`);
        setIsSent(true);
      }}>
        <textarea
          placeholder="Message"
          value={message}
          onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}
        />
        <br />
        <button type="submit">Send</button>
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

</Sandpack>

Remember, Hooks must be called unconditionally and always in the same order!

You could also remove the unnecessary `else` branch to reduce the nesting. However, it's still important that all calls to Hooks happen *before* the first `return`.

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  if (isSent) {
    return <h1>Thank you!</h1>;
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={e => {
      e.preventDefault();
      alert(`Sending: "${message}"`);
      setIsSent(true);
    }}>
      <textarea
        placeholder="Message"
        value={message}
        onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}
      />
      <br />
      <button type="submit">Send</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

Try moving the second `useState` call after the `if` condition and notice how this breaks it again.

If your linter is [configured for React](/learn/editor-setup#linting), you should see a lint error when you make a mistake like this. If you don't see an error when you try the faulty code locally, you need to set up linting for your project. 

</Solution>

#### Remove unnecessary state {/*remove-unnecessary-state*/}

When the button is clicked, this example should ask for the user's name and then display an alert greeting them. You tried to use state to keep the name, but for some reason it always shows "Hello, !".

To fix this code, remove the unnecessary state variable. (We will discuss about [why this didn't work](/learn/state-as-a-snapshot) later.)

Can you explain why this state variable was unnecessary?

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');

  function handleClick() {
    setName(prompt('What is your name?'));
    alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Greet
    </button>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

Here is a fixed version that uses a regular `name` variable declared in the function that needs it:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  function handleClick() {
    const name = prompt('What is your name?');
    alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Greet
    </button>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

A state variable is only necessary to keep information between re-renders of a component. Within a single event handler, a regular variable will do fine. Don't introduce state variables when a regular variable works well.

</Solution>
